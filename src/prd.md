- **Purpose**: Transform raw input into actionable, searchable knowledge
- **Success Criteria**: Relevant summaries, 90%+ task extraction accuracy

### 4. Calendar & Task Management
- **Functionality**: Drag-drop task scheduling, recurring events, daily planning assistance
- **Purpose**: Connect knowledge to action and time management
- **Success Criteria**: Intuitive calendar interaction, reliable scheduling

### 5. Smart Search & Knowledge Graph
- **Functionality**: Full-text search, tag filtering, automatic content linking
- **Purpose**: Enable rapid knowledge retrieval and discovery
- **Success Criteria**: <1 second search response, relevant connection suggestions

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Calm confidence and intellectual clarity
**Design Personality**: Modern, intelligent, and trustworthy - like a sophisticated research tool
**Visual Metaphors**: Neural networks, knowledge connections, flowing information
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Sophisticated minimalism - clean interface that reveals depth on interaction

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous blue-focused palette with warm accent
**Primary Color**: Deep intelligent blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - represents knowledge and trust
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue grays for supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.65 0.18 40)) for actionable elements and highlights
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys intelligence and reliability, amber provides warmth and energy for actions

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings (600-700), medium UI elements (500), regular body text (400)
**Font Personality**: Modern, readable, professional without being sterile
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts - excellent readability and comprehensive character support
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested across all target devices with high contrast ratios

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Left-to-right reading pattern with primary actions on the right
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to prevent cognitive overload
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent 24px spacing units
**Content Density**: Information-rich but not overwhelming, progressive disclosure

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions indicate system intelligence and responsiveness
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Subtle hover effects, smooth modal transitions, gentle loading states
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional context requires subtle, functional animations

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: Shadcn/ui for consistency, Modal for capture, Card for content blocks, Calendar for scheduling
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for their clarity and comprehensive coverage
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's 4px base unit system for mathematical consistency
**Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-first design with 44px minimum touch targets

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Designed for personal use initially, with potential for team collaboration
**Testing Focus**: Keyboard navigation, AI processing accuracy, cross-browser compatibility
**Critical Questions**: How to balance AI automation with user control? How to ensure privacy of sensitive information?

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines immediate capture with intelligent processing, creating a true "second brain" that augments human cognition rather than replacing it. The focus on seamless interaction and AI assistance addresses the core problem of information overload in knowledge work.

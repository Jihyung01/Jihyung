## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable intelligence
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, sophisticated - like a high-end productivity tool
**Visual Metaphors**: Brain/neural networks (subtle), library/organization, workflow automation
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with progressive disclosure of advanced features

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - communicates trust, intelligence, depth
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays and off-whites for backgrounds and structure
**Accent Color**: Brighter blue (oklch(0.65 0.18 250)) - for highlighting actions and important elements
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys reliability and intelligence, while maintaining approachability
**Accessibility**: All color combinations exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Primary Font**: Inter - clean, highly legible, modern sans-serif
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headlines: 24px bold
- Subheadings: 18px semibold  
- Body: 14px regular
- Captions: 12px medium
**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, generous paragraph spacing
**Code/Markdown**: Monospace font for technical content

### Spatial Awareness
**Compositional Balance**: Grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy
**Grid System**: 24px base grid with 6px spacing increments
**Breathing Room**: Generous white space between sections, minimal density in primary UI
**Spatial Relationships**: Related elements grouped with proximity, clear separation between sections

### Component Design Guidelines

#### Interactive Elements
**Primary Actions**: High contrast buttons with clear call-to-action styling
**Secondary Actions**: Outline buttons that remain accessible but less prominent
**States**: Distinct hover, active, focused, and disabled states for all interactive elements
**Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements

#### Cards & Layout
**Card Design**: Subtle shadows and borders, rounded corners (8px radius)
**Information Hierarchy**: Clear title/content/action separation in cards
**Loading States**: Skeleton placeholders that match final content structure
**Empty States**: Helpful guidance with clear next actions

#### Calendar Integration
**Event Styling**: Priority-based color coding with clear visual hierarchy
**Interaction Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for drag operations
**Responsive Layout**: Graceful degradation from desktop to mobile views

## Implementation Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent, maintainable styling
- **shadcn/ui** for high-quality, accessible component primitives

### Backend Architecture  
- **Flask** with SQLAlchemy for robust API development
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable data persistence with complex queries
- **Alembic** for version-controlled database migrations
- **OpenAI API** for intelligent content processing

### Key Integrations
- **FullCalendar** for professional calendar functionality
- **Web Audio API** for browser-based audio recording
- **YouTube Transcript API** for video content analysis
- **S3/MinIO** for file storage and management

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Immediate feedback with graceful error handling
- **Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting for faster initial loads
- **Efficient Search**: Database indexing and client-side filtering
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection with Redis-backed throttling

### Security & Privacy
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless user sessions
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
